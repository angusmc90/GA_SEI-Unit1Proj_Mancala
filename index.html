                    <h4 class="subHead">Game Play:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place four stones into each of the pits.</li>
                        <li>The starting player grabs all the stones from one hole on their side and drops them, one by one, into each pit around the board going in a counter-clockwise direction. If the player passes over one of the mancala stores or bowls, he or she would place a stone in there, too. Once the player doesn't have any more stones in hand, it's the other person's turn to do the same thing.</li>
                        <li>If a player has enough stones to hit their own store, they place a stone in it. If it's the player's last stone, they get a free turn to go again. If you pass over another player's store during your turn, you do not place a stone in their pit.</li>
                        <li>The game ends when one player has emptied the six holes of stones on their side. The other player then takes all the stones on their own side and places them into their store (or bowl).</li>
                        <li>The winner of the game is the player with the most stones in their mancala store.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4 class="subHead">Tips:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Get a free turn:</strong> When dropping stones into holes, you can drop one into your own mancala store (bowl). If it's your last stone in your hand, you get another turn.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gather more stones:</strong> One way to amass more stones is by strategically dropping your last stone into an empty hole on your side of the board. If you manage that, you're allowed to reach across the board and take your opponent's stones that are in the opposite hole.</li>
                        <li><strong>Think strategically:</strong> If you go first, pick up the stones in the fourth hole away from your mancala store (bowl). That way, you'll place the last stone in your store, and you'll get a free turn.</li>

            dont forget to add a note for the presentation re: key decisions
            
            ===key decision 1: well identification ==========
            class to note details like pA vs pB, well vs store, etc
            id to note position to make it easier to note when 
            

            ===key decision 2: user vs computer =========
            computer = "playerB"
            user = "playerA"
            to eventually add 2-player version, no "computer"
            using numbers could get confusing in the math fns
